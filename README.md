Our advocacy for our site is cancer awareness. That is why we set up an event that raises money for Non-governmental Organizations that focuses on cancer awareness so that they may further help many more cancer patients world-wide. Our site is simple, we have the home page, the sign-up page, and the confirmation page. The home page will tell you what our site is all about, as well as the details for the tickets for our basketball event. After clicking the sign up button, it will redirect you to the sign up page, wherein the site asks for your details. There is a field set for your first name, last name, sex, email address, password, contact number (not required) and your reasons for supporting the event. They should all be filled up except for the contact number (not required), otherwise upon clicking the sign up button, it will tell you that a certain field should have an input. When all required fields are inputted, the user can therefore click the sign up button and proceed to the confirmation page. In the confirmation page, you can see the details of what you have inputted in the sign up page, because it was saved in the local storage. You can now then click the "back to home" button to proceed back to our home page.
